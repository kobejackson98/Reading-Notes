## Here is What We Learned About In The Readings (Markdown Guide) (https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

## Headings
The Different Heading Levels are created by #


## Paragraphs
To create paragaphs, use a blank line to seperate one or more lines of text.


## Line Breaks
To create a line break or new line (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.


## Edit Text

### Bold Text
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

### Italicize Text
To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.

## Blockquote
To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

## Lists

### Ordered Lists
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers donâ€™t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.

### Unordered Lists
To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

## Links

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com)).

### Titles 

You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in quotation marks after the URL.

### URLs and Email Addresses

To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.

###

To emphasize links, add asterisks before and after the brackets and parentheses. To denote links as code, add backticks in the brackets.

## Understanding  Javascript?

Javascript or JS is a lightweight, interpreted or just-in-time compilier programming language with first-class functions. 

Although JavaScript is most well-known as a scripting language for web pages. Many non-browser environments also use it. Some of those non-browsers are Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.

JavaScript can be be broken down and simplified into three main parts.

1. The language 
2. DOM API
3. Server API

The user can either embed the JavaScript code directly into the HTML file, or the user can put a line in the HTML file that will include the external JavaScript file. Usually the latter is recommended.

## Input 

1. Alert - Will show up a pop-up in the browser with the text.

2. Document.Write - JavaScript code uses the document.write function to change the content of the page and is used to change what is shown.

3. Console.log - This command prints out a message in the console.

## Output 

1. Prompt - Wil show a pop-up window with the text provided as the first parameter and with a textboc the user can fill in. Once the user enters data and press OK or enter the value and text in the box will be returned by the prompt function.

2. Confirm - This isn't really an input method, but it allows the developer/engineer to ask a Yes/No question.

## Variables

Variables - Are containers for storing data

### When to use JavaScript var

1. The user should always declare JavaScript with var, let, or cost.

2. The var keyword is used in all  JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

3. The let and cost keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

4. If the user wants their code to run in older browsers, they must use var.

### When to Use JavaScript const

General Rule: Always declare variables with const.

If the user can think the value of the variable can change, the user should use let.

## JavaScript Identifiers

1. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique name are called identifiers.

Identifies can be short names such as x and y or even more descriptive names such as age, sum, totalVolume.

### General Rules For Constructing Names For Variables;

1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.

2. Names must begin with a letter.

3. Names can also begin with $ and _

4. Names are case sensitive ( y and Y are different variables.)

5. Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

## More JavaScript Info

1. In the JavaScript language the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

2. The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.

JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like " Kobe Jackson".

In programming, text calues are called text strings.

Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

If a user put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

Creating a variable in JavaScript is called " declaring" a variable.

The user can declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword.

The user can assign a value to a variable using the equal sign.

### JavaScript Arithmentic

As with algebra, the user can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like = and +:

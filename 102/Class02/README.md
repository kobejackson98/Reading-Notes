The reason this topic matters is because it is teaching us the importance of knowing how the computer operates and how to navigate the computer easily.

### Understanding The Lessons

In the following sections we will focus on the four websites listed to gain knowledge on these topics.

#### Text Editor

Text Editor - A text editor is a software a user can download or find online. The main purpose is to use the software or platform to enter text to help you build a website.

##### Features The User Should Look For In A Text Editor.

1. Syntax Highlighting
2. Themes
3. Code Completion

##### Understanding Text Editors And IDE's

IDE - Integrated Development Environment. An IDE has many functions, it is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software.

Text Editors - Main job is to edit and manage texts and different files.




#### The Command Line

The Command Line - A Text Based Interface To The System.

To answer the question of why this topic matters. Command Lines matter and are important because they allow us to interact with a computer by typing and entering commands, in which the computer or command line will then give us feedback.


##### Command Line Operations

1. The Command Line presents us with a prompt.
2. The User than enters a command (ls)
3. After the Command we n


#### Opening a Terminal ( Mac OS Users)

1. First Step is to search for the terminal by hitting the Command Button + The Space Bar
2. Second Step is to search " Terminal" in the spacebar of the Spotlight Search


#### The Shell, Bash 

1. Inside the terminal you have the shell, this is the part of the operating system that shows/defines how the terminal will work and look are running the particular commands.
2. There are different shells available but the most common one is called bash.
3. To see what shell you are using, you can use the command echo. " Echo is a command line which is used to display messages."


#### The Command Line Shortcuts 

First Shortcut: When the user enters commands, those commands are stored in history! The user is able to search this history using the up and down keys. By doing this you don't have to waste time retyping commands.

### Basic Navigation 


#### Abbreviations: A Lot of Commands in Linux are named as an abbreviation of a word or words describing them, by doing this it makes them easier to remember and use at a later date.

**PWD** - Print Working Directory (This command tells you what your current working directory is) 
  - **PWD** is important because  I will use it  to make use of this command to remind myself of where I presently am working.

**ls** - List ( This command tells you what is in your current directory. But ** ls ** can be used more powerfully 


#### Paths 

 A **path** is a means to get a particular file or directory on your system.
 
 What are are two different types of **paths**?
 1. **Absolute Paths** -  Specify a location ( directory or file) in relation to the root directory. *Tip* : You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash (/)


 2. **Relative Paths** -  Specify a location ( directory or file) in relation to where we currently are in the system. *Tip* : They will not begin with a slash.


#### Additional Info 

**~** (tilde) - This is a shortcut for the users home directory.
**.** (dot) -  This is a reference for the users current directory.
**..** (dotdot)  - This is a reference for the parent directory.

**cd** - Stands for change of directory, also allows you to move around in the system. *Tip* : If the user runs this command **cd** without any arguments then it will take the user back to the home directory.

### More Information On Files

**file** obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
 **ls - a** List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
 
 1. Everything is a file under Linux Even directories.
 2. Linux is an extensionless system Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
 3. Linux is **CASE** sensitive

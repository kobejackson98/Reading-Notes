## Lesson Breakdown

### Lesson One: Control Flow

Control Flow: The order in which the computer executes statements in script.  

Usually code is ran in order from the first line of code to the final line of code, unless the users computer runs across structures that causes the flow to change. Such structures can be conditionals and loops this can happen extremely frequent.  

Conditionals: A Condition is a set of rules that can interrupt normal code execution or change it, depending on whether the condition is completed or not.

Loops: A loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is met.

A typical script in JavaScript or PHP includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.

Control Flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

### Lesson Two: Functions  

JavaScript Function: Is a block of code designed to perfrom a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" calls it.

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, the same rules as variables.

Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function.

Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

Function Invocation: The code inside the function will execute when "something" calls the function:

1. When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)

2. When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code.

3. Automatically (self invoked

Function Return is when a JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.  

If the function was invokedd from a statement, JavaScript will return to execute the code after the invoking statement.  

To be noted: Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned back to the "caller".

#### More Info On Functions?  

The user can reuse code: The user can define the code once, and use it many times even with different arguments to produce different results.

Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.

Functions can be used the same way as the user use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.

Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become Local to the function, Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.

### Lesson Three JavaScript Operators

There are different types of JavaScript operators.

1. Arithmetic Operators - Used to perfrom arithmetic on numbers.

2. Assignment Operators - Assign values to JavaScript variables.

3. Comparison Operators - Used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

4. Logical Operators - Used to determine the logic between variables or values.

5. Conditional Operators - Assignes a value to a variable based on some condition.  

6. Type Operators - Based off the description/example. Can return the type of a variable,

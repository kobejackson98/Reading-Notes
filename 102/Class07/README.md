## Lesson Breakdown

### Lesson One: Control Flow

Control Flow: The order in which the computer executes statements in script.  

Usually code is ran in order from the first line of code to the final line of code, unless the users computer runs across structures that causes the flow to change. Such structures can be conditionals and loops this can happen extremely frequent.  

Conditionals: A Condition is a set of rules that can interrupt normal code execution or change it, depending on whether the condition is completed or not.

Loops: A loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is met.

A typical script in JavaScript or PHP includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.

Control Flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

### Lesson Two: Functions  

JavaScript Function: Is a block of code designed to perfrom a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" calls it.

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, the same rules as variables.

Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function.

Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

Function Invocation: The code inside the function will execute when "something" calls the function:

1. When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)

2. When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code.

3. Automatically (self invoked

Function Return is when a JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

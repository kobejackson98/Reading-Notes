## Lesson Breakdown

### What Is CSS?

CSS = Cascading Style Sheets

Function Of CSS: Allows the user to create great looking webpages. We can compare web development to constructing a house. HTML is the frame of the house, while CSS is the paint, etc. " The web would be a boring place if all websites looked alike. Using CSS we can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser."

CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users, how they are styled, laid out, etc.

CSS can be used for basic document text-styling, such as changing the color and size of headings and links.

### CSS Syntax  

CSS is a rule- based language. The user defines the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on the users web page.

### Additional CSS Info  
 
A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.

CSS can be use for changing the font, font size and color of different tags such as the h1 tag.

### How To Add CSS

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet.  

1. External CSS - Allows the user to change the look of an entire website by changing just one file. Requires each HTML page to include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the link element, inside of the head section. External Style Sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.  

2. Internal CSS - An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. The internal style is defined inside the style element, inside the head section of an HTML page.

3. Inline CSS - An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline styles,  the user should add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute has the power to contain any CSS property.

### CSS Color Property

The Color property specifies the color of text.

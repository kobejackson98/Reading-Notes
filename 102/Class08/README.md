## Expressions and Operators  

Expression Definition: A valid unit of code that resolves to a value.  

All complex expressions are joined by operators, such as = and +.

### List Of Operators  

1. Assignment Operators
2. Comparison Operators
3. Arithmetic Operators
4. Bitwise Operators
5. Logical Operators
6. BigInt Operators
7. String Operators
8. Conditional(ternary) Operator
9. Comma Operator
10. Unary Operators
11. Relational Operators


#### Assignment Operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.

#### Destructuring  

For more complex assignments, the destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals.

#### Comparison Operators  

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numberical, string, logical, or object values.

#### Arithmetic Operators  

An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. The standard arithmetic operators are addition, substraction, multiplication and division.  

#### Bitwise Operators

A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits(zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers.

#### Logical Operators

Logical operators are typically used with Boolean(logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. 

#### Conditional(ternary) Operator

The conditional operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. The operator can have one set of two values based on a condition.

#### Comma Operator

The comma operator evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand. This particular operator is primarily used inside a for loop, to allow multiple variables to be updated each time through the loop.

#### Unary Operators

A unary operation is an operation with only one operand.

The delete operator deletes an object's property.

the typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.

The void operator specifies an expression to be evaluated without returning a value.


#### Relational Operators  

A relational operator compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on whether the comparison is true.

The instanceof operator returns true if the specified object is of the specifies object type.  

#### Basic Expressions

All operators eventually operate on one or more basic expressions. These basic expressions include identifiers and literals, but a few other kinds do exist.

#### Grouping Operator

The grouping operator () controls the precedence of evaluation in expressions.

## Loops and Iteration  

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.  

There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.

The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:  

1. For statement  
2. do... while statement
3. while statement  
4. labeled statement  
5. break statement  
6. continue statement  
7. for...in statement  
8. for... of statement  

### For Statement  

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.  

### Do...while Statement  

The do... while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

### While Statement  

A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.  

### Labeled Statement  

A label provides a statement with an identifier that lets you refer to it elsewhere in the user program.

### Break Statement  

The user can use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjuction with a labeled statement.  

### Continue Statement  

The continue statement can be used to restart a while, do-while, for, or label statement.  

### For In Statement

The for... in statement iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object.

### For Of Statement  

The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects(including Array, Map,Set, arguments object and so on) invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be ececuted for the value of each distinct property.

## Expressions and Operators  

Expression Definition: A valid unit of code that resolves to a value.  

All complex expressions are joined by operators, such as = and +.

### List Of Operators  

1. Assignment Operators
2. Comparison Operators
3. Arithmetic Operators
4. Bitwise Operators
5. Logical Operators
6. BigInt Operators
7. String Operators
8. Conditional(ternary) Operator
9. Comma Operator
10. Unary Operators
11. Relational Operators


#### Assignment Operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.

#### Destructuring  

For more complex assignments, the destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals.

#### Comparison Operators  

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numberical, string, logical, or object values.


## Loops and Iteration  

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.  

There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.

The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:  

1. For statement  
2. do... while statement
3. while statement  
4. labeled statement  
5. break statement  
6. continue statement  
7. for...in statement  
8. for... of statement  

### For Statement  

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.  

A for statement looks as follows:  

for (initialization; condition; afterthought)
  statement


### While Statement  

A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.  

A while statement looks as follows:  

while (condition)
  statement
